        <!-- SECTION 1 -->
        <div id="section1">
            <h1>Home</h1>
            <p>
               Welcome to my ePortfolio!

               My name is Maxence PIERROT, and I am an aspiring aerospace engineer currently studying at ENSEEIHT, an engineering school in Toulouse, France. I am currently studying electronics and automation to design and build robot that will be sent into space. This ePortfolio showcases my academic projects, personal experiences, and professional ambitions.

Through this platform, I aim to share my journey as an engineering student, from developing technical skills to exploring new challenges in science and technology. I hope it will reflect both my passion for aerospace and my motivation to contribute to future innovations.

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->
        <div id="section2">
            <h1>Engineering Courses</h1>
            <p>
               As part of my engineering courses at Prépa T², I worked on a practical project in optics focused on optical stroboscopy and Abbe’s experiment. In the first hand this project aimed to deepen our understanding of light phenomena, image formation, and the physical limits of optical systems. In the other hand, my group and I learned how to work in a team and how to manage our project. 
                
            </p>
         
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->
        <div id="section3">
            <h1>Mobility</h1>
            <p>
                As part of my engineering studies, I plan to take part in international mobility programs in both Japan and Norway, each for different but complementary reasons.

My first goal is to spend time in Japan to learn the Japanese language and experience a completely different cultural environment. I believe that understanding another culture helps to develop open-mindedness, adaptability, and communication skills—qualities that are essential for any future engineer working in a global context. Japan’s balance between tradition and cutting-edge technology also deeply inspires me.

Later, I plan to study in Norway, a country recognized for its academic excellence in electronics and automation. This experience will allow me to strengthen my technical expertise while discovering a new way of approaching engineering education and innovation.

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->
        <div id="section4">
            <h1>Civic Engagement</h1>
            <p>
                In the future, I would like to participate in outreach programs that promote science and technology among young students. I am particularly interested in volunteering for educational associations that inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->
        <div id="section5">
            <h1>Sport & Activities</h1>
            <p>
                Outside of my academic work, I dedicate time to a variety of sports, artistic, and technical activities that help me maintain balance and develop different aspects of my personality.

I practice orienteering and judo, two disciplines that have taught me concentration, endurance, and discipline. Orienteering strengthens my decision-making skills under pressure, while judo has helped me build resilience, respect, and a sense of fair play.

I am also passionate about creative hobbies such as drawing and sewing. These activities allow me to express my artistic side and develop patience and attention to detail—qualities that are also very valuable in engineering.

In addition, I am a member of a robotics club, where I collaborate with other students to design and program robots. This activity combines teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation, perfectly linking my personal interests with my professional goals.

Finally, I enjoy video games, both as a source of entertainment and as a way to explore design and simulation logic.

Through these diverse activities, I have learned to balance technical rigor with creativity, and to approach challenges with both precision and imagination—a mindset that I hope to bring into my future engineering career.

        <!-- SECTION 6 -->
        <div id="section6">
            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>
                the design, automation, and control of robotic systems for space exploration. I am particularly interested in how electronics, automation, and artificial intelligence can be combined to make autonomous robots capable of operating in extreme environments such as space or other planets.

           <a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank" class="btn_one">Here is my CV</a>
             <p>
                In the future, I aspire to work for leading organizations such as Airbus, the European Space Agency (ESA), the French Space Agency (CNES), or ONERA, where I could contribute to cutting-edge research and development in aerospace and robotics.
